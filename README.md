NASA space challenge

Prototype of the project, which has been built during hackathon in Link√∂ping, Sweden. Its' aim is to make air cleaner and overall citizens' health.  


General concept is based on obtaining data about air pollution(level of carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide) from NASA and improving them(since resolution is only 2km) with sensors, which are supposed to voyage together with balloons in small areas of high interest.

Also, from citizens' prospect, they can provide some necessary information about themselves(chronic diseases) as well as whether they had some symptoms(with clarifying details) recently. Based on this information, further step of the project is to analyze all this information, get statistics about number of people with certain symptoms in a certain time, find correlations between people health and concentration of dangerous substances in the air, make some suggestions to the user.
