carbon monoxide
sulfur dioxide
nitrogen dioxide

## General pollution:
- Cancer (http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/air-pollution-radon-and-cancer/how-air-pollution-can-cause-cancer)
”The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) assigned sulfur dioxide to Group 3, not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans.” (http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mmg/mmg.asp?id=249&tid=46)

## Sulfur dioxide:
Least concentration for symptoms to occur:0.25 ppm
Concentration where airways are damaged: 10 ppm

- worsening asthma and emphysema (very low concentration)
- Bronchospasm (consequence of severe asthma) 
- pneumonitis
- pulmonary edema
- chronic cardiopulmonary disease 
- Reactive Airway Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS) (high level of exposure)
- Irritated skin
- Nausea (high levels)
- Vomiting (high levels)
- abdominal pain (high levels)

#### Allergy effects
